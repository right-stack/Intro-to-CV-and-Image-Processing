# Intro-to-CV-and-Image-Processing

[Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-computer-vision-watson-opencv?specialization=ai-engineer)
This course uses Python, Pillow and OpenCV for basic image processing and perform image classification and object detection.

This is the third course on the [IBM AI Engineering Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer) on Coursera.

* 1 - Introduction to Computer Vision 
* 2 - Image Processing with OpenCV and Pillow
* 3 - Machine Learning Image Classification
* 4 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning for Image Classification
* 5 - Object Detection
* 6 - Project Case: Not Quite a Self-Driving Car - Traffic Sign Classification.
